### Notable Work and Accomplishments

- In my artificial intelligence ethics research in the summer of 2019, I investigated models of ethical decision-making procedures for AI, focusing on the intelligence of neural networks and agency of self-driving cars. The resulting research bibliography now helps form and advance L&Câ€™s future data studies institute. I evaluated the social and legal impacts of current practices and new possibilities for ethical AI software development, sought to optimize public communication, and authored a research project on data ethics and personal privacy rights. I partnered with my philosophy advisor, [Joel Martinez,](https://college.lclark.edu/live/profiles/75-joel-martinez) and we were funded by a Student-Faculty Collaborative Research Grant from the Lewis & Clark Dean of Students' office.
