### Notable Work and Accomplishments

- As an Alumni Teaching Assistant, I help facilitate a course for alumni and parents, The Moral Machine: A Humanistic Approach to AI and Big Data, which covers topics such as knowledge, privacy, and justice to understand legal, social, and political impacts of AI. I created a [course overview](https://www.eatdrinkscenicviews.com/the-moral-machine) web page and a [course resources](https://www.eatdrinkscenicviews.com/moral-machine-resources) web page using Wix website editing software. I meet weekly with Professor Joel Martinez and Office of Alumni members to determine the structure for the week's class. I plann and deliver contributions on my areas of research expertise, and answer students’ questions about the course materials.

- In my artificial intelligence ethics research in the summer of 2019, I investigated models of ethical decision-making procedures for AI, focusing on the intelligence of neural networks and agency of self-driving cars. The resulting research bibliography now helps form and advance L&C’s future data studies institute. I evaluated the social and legal impacts of current practices and new possibilities for ethical AI software development, sought to optimize public communication, and authored a research project on data ethics and personal privacy rights. I partnered with my philosophy advisor, [Joel Martinez,](https://college.lclark.edu/live/profiles/75-joel-martinez) and we were funded by a Student-Faculty Collaborative Research Grant from the Lewis & Clark Dean of Students' office.
